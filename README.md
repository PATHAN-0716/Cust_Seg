# Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or other characteristics. This project applies **unsupervised learning techniques** such as **K-Means clustering** to segment customers effectively.

## ðŸš€ Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: We use a dataset containing customer attributes such as **age, income, spending score**, etc.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scale numerical features, and remove outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize customer distribution using **histograms, pair plots, and box plots**.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Select the most relevant features for clustering.
5. **Clustering Model**:
   - Use **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters.
   - Apply **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers.
   - Optionally, compare with **Hierarchical Clustering** or **DBSCAN**.
6. **Visualization**: Plot customer clusters in **2D/3D space**.
7. **Insights & Business Recommendations**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Dataset Used**: Mall Customers Dataset
- **Features**:
  - `CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier
  - `Age`: Age of the customer
  - `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income in thousand dollars
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned by the store based on customer behavior

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Requirements
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## ðŸš€ Running the Project
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights
- Identified distinct customer groups such as **high-income high spenders, low-income low spenders, and moderate spenders**.
- Helped businesses tailor **marketing strategies** based on customer segments.
- Improved **customer retention and targeted promotions**.

## ðŸ“Œ Visualizations
- **Elbow Method Graph** for optimal `k` selection.
- **Clustered Customer Segments** using **scatter plots**.
- **Box Plots & Histograms** to analyze feature distributions.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements
- Implement **Deep Learning-based Autoencoders** for advanced segmentation.
- Use **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** for better segmentation.
- Deploy as a **web app using Flask/Streamlit**.
